A Tic Tac Toe JavaScript application is a program that allows users to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe in a web browser. Here's a description of how the application might work:

1. User Interface: The application provides a user interface that displays a 3x3 grid, representing the Tic Tac Toe board. Each cell of the grid can be empty, or it can contain an "X" or an "O" symbol indicating the moves made by the players.

2. Game Logic: The application includes a JavaScript logic that keeps track of the state of the game. It knows whose turn it is (either player "X" or player "O"), and it keeps track of the moves made by both players on the board.

3. Player Interaction: The application allows users to interact with the game by clicking on the empty cells of the grid. When a user clicks on a cell, the JavaScript logic determines if the move is valid (i.e., the cell is empty) and updates the state of the game accordingly.

4. Turn Alternation: After each valid move, the application switches the turn to the other player, allowing them to make their move. This process continues until a win condition is met or the game ends in a draw.

5. Win Condition: The application checks after each move if the game has been won by either player. It examines the state of the board to see if there are three matching symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal. If a win condition is detected, the application declares the winner and the game ends.

6. Draw Condition: If all the cells on the board are filled, and no win condition is met, the game is declared a draw.

7. Restart Option: After the game ends (either due to a win or a draw), the application provides an option to restart the game, clearing the board and allowing the players to start a new game.

By combining these elements, a Tic Tac Toe JavaScript application provides an interactive and enjoyable experience for users to play the classic game against each other or against an AI opponent.
